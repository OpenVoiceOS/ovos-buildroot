Subject: [PATCH 118/198] printk: Wait for all reserved records with pr_flush()

Currently pr_flush() will only wait for records that were
available to readers at the time of the call (using
prb_next_seq()). But there may be more records (non-finalized)
that have following finalized records. pr_flush() should wait
for these to print as well. Particularly because any trailing
finalized records may be the messages that the calling context
wants to ensure are printed.

Add a new ringbuffer function prb_next_reserve_seq() to return
the sequence number following the most recently reserved record.
This guarantees that pr_flush() will wait until all current
printk() messages (completed or in progress) have been printed.

Fixes: 3b604ca81202 ("printk: add pr_flush()")
