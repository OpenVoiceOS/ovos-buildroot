	  This benchmark was designed for identifying basic system
	  parameters, as they are important for system using MySQL (w
	  Innodb) under intensive load. Handling of IO in case of many
	  parallel requests, checked as well as memory allocation
	  /transfer speed and scheduler performance. CPU is benchmarked
	  by using 64bit integer manipulation using Euklid algorithms
	  for prime number computation. Benchmarks are designed to show
	  benefit of multiple CPUs as well as of multiple hard drives,
	  battery backed up write cache.
