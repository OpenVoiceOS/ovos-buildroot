=========
colorzero
=========

colorzero is a color manipulation library for Python (yes, *another* one) which
aims to be reasonably simple to use and "pythonic" in nature.

It does *not* aim to be as comprehensive, powerful, or that matter as *correct*
as, say, `colormath`_.  colorzero originally grew out of work on my `picamera`_
project, hence it's intended to be sufficiently simple that school children can
use it without having to explain color spaces and illuminants. However, it does
aim to be useful to a wide range of skills, hence it does include basic
facilities for `CIE Lab`_ representations, and `Delta-E`_ calculations should
you need them.

The major difference between colorzero and other libraries (`grapefruit`_,
`colormath`_, etc.) is that its ``Color`` class is a ``namedtuple`` descendent.
This means it is immutable; you cannot *directly* change the attributes of a
``Color`` instance. The major advantage of this is that instances can be used
as keys in dictionaries (for simple `LUTs`_), or placed in sets.

Manipulation of ``Color`` instances is done by typical operations with other
classes the result of which is a new ``Color`` instance. For example::

    >>> Color('red') + Color('blue')
    <Color html='#ff00ff' rgb=(1, 0, 1)>
    >>> Color('magenta') - Color('red')
    <Color html='#0000ff' rgb=(0, 0, 1)>
    >>> Color('red') - Red(0.5)
    <Color html='#800000' rgb=(0.5, 0, 0)>
    >>> Color('green') + Color('grey').red
    <Color html='#808000' rgb=(0.501961, 0.501961, 0)>
    >>> Color.from_hls(0.5, 0.5, 1.0)
    <Color html='#00ffff' rgb=(0, 1, 1)>
    >>> Color.from_hls(0.5, 0.5, 1.0) * Lightness(0.8)
    <Color html='#00cccc' rgb=(0, 0.8, 0.8)>
    >>> (Color.from_hls(0.5, 0.5, 1.0) * Lightness(0.8)).hls
    HLS(h=0.5, l=0.4, s=1.0)
