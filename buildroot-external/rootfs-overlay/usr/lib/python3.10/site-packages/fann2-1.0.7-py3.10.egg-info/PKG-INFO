fann2
=====

Python bindings for Fast Artificial Neural Networks 2.2.0 (FANN >= 2.2.0). These
are the original python bindings included with FANN 2.1.0beta and updated to
include support for python 2.6-3.4.


DESCRIPTION
===========

This is a python binding for Fast Artificial Neural Network Library (FANN >=
2.2.0) that implements multilayer artificial neural networks with support for
both fully-connected and sparsely-connected networks. It includes a framework
for easy handling of training data sets. It is easy to use, versatile, well-
documented, and fast.

FANN 2.2.0 source

INSTALLATION
============

You can install fann2 from pkgsrc or from pypi, using either pip or
easy_install:

pypi
----


    $ pip install fann2
    

or


    $ easy_install fann2

pkgsrc
------


Source installation
...................

Get and install pkgsrc. See `pkgsrc documentation
<http://pkgsrc.org/#index4h1>`_. for platform-specific information.

cd ${PKGSRCDIR}/devel/py-fann2

bmake install


From binaries
.............

Get and install pkgsrc. See `pkgsrc quickstart
<http://pkgsrc.org/#index1h1>`_. for platform-specific information.

pkgin -y install py-fann2


USAGE
=====
Just 


    >> from fann2 import libfann 


and then create libfann.neural_net and libfann.training_data objects


    >> ann = libfann.neural_net()
    
    >> train_data = libfann.training_data()


Look at the examples at the FANN documentation and its C++ bindings for further
reference.
