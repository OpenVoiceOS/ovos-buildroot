PyMeeus
=======

   **Library of astronomical algorithms in Python**.

PyMeeus is a Python implementation of the astronomical algorithms
described in the classical book 'Astronomical Algorithms, 2nd Edition,
Willmann-Bell Inc. (1998)' by Jean Meeus.

There are great astronomical libraries out there. For instance, if
you're looking for high precision and speed you should take a look at
`libnova <http://libnova.sourceforge.net/>`__. For a set of python
modules aimed at professional astronomers, you should look at
`Astropy <http://www.astropy.org/>`__. On the other hand, the advantages
of PyMeeus are its simplicity, ease of use, ease of reading, ease of
installation (it has the minimum amount of dependencies) and abundant
documentation.

Installation
------------

The easiest way of installing PyMeeus is using pip:

.. code:: sh

   pip install pymeeus

Or, for a per-user installation:

.. code:: sh

   pip install --user pymeeus

If you prefer Python3, you can use:

.. code:: sh

   pip3 install --user pymeeus

If you have PyMeeus already installed, but want to upgrade to the latest
version:

.. code:: sh

   pip3 install -U pymeeus

``LICENSE.txt`` and ``COPYING.LESSER`` for more information.

Documentation: https://pymeeus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

GitHub: https://github.com/architest/pymeeus

If you have Sphinx installed, you can generate your own, latest
documentation going to directory 'docs' and issuing:

.. code:: sh

   make html

Then the HTML documentation pages can be found in 'build/html'.

Contributing
------------

The preferred method to contribute is through forking and pull requests:

1. Fork it (https://github.com/architest/pymeeus/fork)
2. Create your feature branch (``git checkout -b feature/fooBar``)
3. Commit your changes (``git commit -am 'Add some fooBar'``)
4. Push to the branch (``git push origin feature/fooBar``)
5. Create a new Pull Request

Please bear in mind that PyMeeus follows the PEP8 style guide for Python
code `(PEP8) <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/?>`__. We suggest
you install and use a linter like
`Flake8 <http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/>`__ before contributing.

Additionally, PyMeeus makes heavy use of automatic tests. As a general
rule, every function or method added must have a corresponding test in
the proper place in ``tests`` directory.

Finally, documentation is also a big thing here. Add proper and abundant
documentation to your new code. This also includes in-line comments!!!.
