> A simple and lightweight [gpsd](https://gpsd.gitlab.io/gpsd) client and library

## Installation

Needs Python 3 (no other dependencies).
If you want to use the library, use pip:

```
pip3 install gpsdclient
```

If you want to use only the standalone gpsd viewer, I recommend to use pipx:

```
pipx install gpsdclient
```

## Library usage

```python
from gpsdclient import GPSDClient

client = GPSDClient(host="127.0.0.1")

# get your data as json strings:
for result in client.json_stream():
    print(result)

# or as python dicts (optionally convert time information to `datetime` objects)
for result in client.dict_stream(convert_datetime=True):
    if result["class"] == "TPV":
        print("Latitude: %s" % result.get("lat", "n/a"))
        print("Longitude: %s" % result.get("lon", "n/a"))

# you can optionally filter by report class
for result in client.dict_stream(filter=["TPV", "SKY"]):
    print(result)
```

You can find the documentation for the available data and JSON fields in the
[gpsd_json(5) manpage](https://www.mankier.com/5/gpsd_json).

## Command line usage

You can use the `gpsdclient` standalone program or execute the module with
`python3 -m gpsdclient`.

```

Or use the raw json mode:

```json
$ gpsdclient --json

^C
```

All command line options:

```
$ gpsdclient -h
usage: gpsdclient [-h] [--host HOST] [--port PORT] [--json]

Connect to a running gpsd instance and show human readable output.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help   show this help message and exit
  --host HOST  The host running GPSD (default: 127.0.0.1)
  --port PORT  GPSD port (default: 2947)
  --json       Output as JSON strings (default: False)
```

## Why

I made this because I just needed a simple client library to read the json data gpsd is
sending.
The other python libraries have various problems, like 100 % cpu usage, missing python 3
support, license problems, lots of dependencies or they aren't available on PyPI.
I also wanted a simple gpsd client to check if everything is working.

This client is as simple as possible with one exception: It supports the automatic
conversion of "time" data into `datetime.datetime` objects.

Have fun, hope you like it.
